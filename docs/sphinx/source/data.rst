Input Data
----------------
At least two files of baselines are needed for the simulation: 1) one file with module parameters throughout the years, for example *baseline_US*, and 2) one or more files with process parameters for each material being analyzed in the module, for example *baseline_glass*. See **baseline_module** and **baseline_material** for more details on input columns needed and their definition. 

The baselines folder in the PV_ICE tool provides baseline scenarios for modules in the US and World level, as well as baseline_materials for glass, Silver and Aluminum. For more details on the source of these values, see the documentation on baselines.
