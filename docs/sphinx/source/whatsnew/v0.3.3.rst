* Added raw, inputs, outputs, figures folders for saving simulation files.
* Simulations can also now be saved as pickles, for easy use and load.

Code Updates
------------
* Updated default "reducecapacity" to False, i.e. by default, bifaciality will not affect installed capacity, it will be bonus energy generation
* Improved internal data path for baselines folder
* Additional math added to energy calculations layer to support carbon calculations

Baseline Updates
-----------------
* Baselines for Roger Nagle's Master thesis exploring European deployment and sustainability pathways scenarios added
* Carbon baselines added (still under development)

Documentation Updates
----------------------
* Reorganized documentation folder into tutorials, publications, and baseline development documents
